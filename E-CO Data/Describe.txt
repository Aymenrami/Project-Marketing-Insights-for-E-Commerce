### Relationships Between the Tables:
- **CustomersData** and **Online_Sales**: They have a direct relationship through `CustomerID`. This allows us to link personal customer data (such as gender and location) with their transactions.

- **Discount_Coupon** and **Online_Sales**: The relationship is through `Product_Category` and `Coupon_Status`. We can determine whether a coupon was used in a particular sale and what the discount percentage was.

- **Marketing_Spend** and **Online_Sales**: This is an indirect but important relationship. We can link marketing expenses on a specific day with sales on the same day to understand the impact of marketing on sales.

- **TAX_Amount** and **Online_Sales**: The relationship here is `Product_Category`. Different taxes apply depending on the product category, allowing us to calculate the tax for each sale.

These relationships between the tables enable us to conduct in-depth analyses, such as revenue calculations, customer understanding, marketing campaign evaluations, and more.
